Drupal-vim is a simple drupal-friendly vim configuration.
It also contains two simple scripts to
- generate tags for a project (that will be stored to ~/.vim/tags directory)
- generate a dictionary for a project (that will be stored in dictionnaries directory).

It already contains a drupal 6 dictionnary.
