Drupal-vim is a simple drupal-friendly vim configuration.
It also contains two simple scripts to
- generate tags for a project (that will be stored to ~/.vim/tags directory)
- generate a dictionary for a project (that will be stored in dictionnaries directory).

It already contains a drupal 6 dictionnary and a bundle of snippets for hooks
and commun php functions.

PLUG-INS :
vim-pathogen : clean installation / removal of plug-ins
project : emulate a file explorer with a simple and editable text file.
snipMate : a nice snippet generator : just type "hook_menu", press tab and it will generate a hook_menu for you :-)
